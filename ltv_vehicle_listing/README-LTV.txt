1) Installed airflow  and docker in my personal laptop.
2) Tried to install database and was able to connect it locally.
3) created sqls as per the requirements mentioned in the document.
4) Built the sqls and tested it locally. Looks good from my end.
5) Built the airflow dag to perform the tasks mentioned.
6) Installed the packages to establish connection from Postgres but not successful. Removed Postgres and installed Mysql and not able to establish connection connection between airflow and mysql.
